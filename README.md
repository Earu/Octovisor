### Octovisor
Octovisor is a message service that allows you to **share objects and values easily between your different .NET applications**. It is composed of a message server that will run on its own and a client API that will let you communicate with other processes using that API on the same server.

### Current state
Currently Octovisor is still in its early development, I am always looking for help and feedback on my work, it helps me provide a quality experience, so if you believe you can help in any ways, please do.

### Future
Once the .NET version is free of bugs and necessary improvements I might start writing other implementations of the client in other well-known languages to allow Octovisor to evolve through an extended eco-system.
