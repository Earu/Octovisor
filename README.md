### Octovisor
Octovisor is a message service that allows you to **share objects and values easily between your different .NET applications**. It is composed of a message server that will run on its own and a client API that will let you communicate with other processes using that API on the same server.

### Current state
Currently Octovisor is still in development, but once it is ready for its alpha the tag **\[WIP\]** will be removed from the repository description. I am always looking for help and feedback on my work, it helps me provide a quality experience, so if you believe you can help in anyways by any means do so.


### Future
Once the .NET version is fully functional I might start writing other implementation of the client in other well-known languages to allow Octovisor to evolve through an extended eco-system.
